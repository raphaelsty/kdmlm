At this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress, model, and socialite |Brooke Shields| and had lost interest in the game.
Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev (tennis) in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining Rod Laver, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson and Don Budge—these have since been joined by |Roger Federer|, |Rafael Nadal|, and |Novak Djokovic|) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career.
The record was later surpassed by |Roger Federer| in 2018.

In 2009, in |Macau| Agassi and Sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 US Open final.
Partnered with Roger Federer and |Rafael Nadal|, the old rivals began making jokes at each others expense, which ended up with Sampras intentionally striking a serve at Agassis body.
He returned to the tour in May 2017 in the position of coach to |Novak Djokovic| for the French Open.
Agassi, along with five athlete partners (including Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana, |Shaquille O'Neal|, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Monica Seles) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named Official All Star Café in April 1996.
and opened 18 concept restaurants in San Francisco, San Jose, California, Dana Point, |Atlantic City| and Las Vegas.
In 1990, he appeared in a television commercial for |Canon Inc.|, promoting the Canon EOS Rebel camera.
They both endorsed Deutsche Telekom in 2002, Genworth Financial and |Canon Inc.| in 2004, LVMH in 2007, and |Nintendo| Wii and Wii Fit U and Longines in 2013.
In the early 1990s, after dating Wendi Stewart, Agassi dated American singer and entertainer |Barbra Streisand|.
Dating Barbra Streisand is like wearing Hot Lava." He was married to |Brooke Shields| from 1997 to 1999.
He married Steffi Graf on October 22, 2001 at their |Las Vegas| home; the only witnesses were their mothers.
In response to this revelation, |Roger Federer| declared himself shocked and disappointed, while Marat Safin argued that Agassi should return his prize money and be stripped of his titles.
He is the 5th of 8 male players in history (after Don Budge, Fred Perry, Rod Laver and Roy Emerson, and before |Roger Federer|, |Rafael Nadal| and |Novak Djokovic|) to achieve this.
Considered by numerous sources to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Agassi has also been called one of the greatest service returners ever to play the game, and was described by the |BBC| upon his retirement as "perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sports history".
 Austroasiatic languages The Austroasiatic languages , also known as Mon–Khmer , are a large language family of Mainland Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout parts of |India|, |Bangladesh|, |Nepal|, and southern China.
Of these languages, only Vietnamese language, Khmer language and Mon language have a long-established recorded history and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern national languages (in |Vietnam| and |Cambodia|, respectively).
The Mon language is a recognized indigenous language in |Myanmar| and |Thailand|.
The name "Austroasiatic" comes from a combination of the |Latin| words for "South" and "Asia", hence "South Asia".
Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon–Khmer languages of |Southeast Asia|, North-East India and the Nicobar Islands, and the Munda languages of East India and Central India and parts of |Bangladesh|, parts of |Nepal|.
Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the Pearl River (China) watershed of Lingnan, which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the Mekong River via |Yunnan|.
Indian linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as |Hindi|, Punjabi language and Bengali language were borrowed from Munda languages.
 suggests that Haplogroup O-M95, which is common in Austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern China, and haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today |Japanese people|, |Koreans| and some Manchu people, are the carriers of Yangtze civilization (Baiyue).
According to Chaubey et al., "Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from |Southeast Asia|, followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations." According to Riccio et al., the Munda people are likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia.
 Afroasiatic languages Afroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Afrasian or Hamito-Semitic or Semito-Hamitic, is a large language family of about 300 languages that are spoken predominantly in Western Asia, |North Africa|, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel.
By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is |Arabic|.
Proposed locations include the Horn of Africa, |North Africa|, the Eastern Sahara and the Levant.
Scholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including the following five branches, whereas Omotic is disputed: Although there is general agreement on these six families, |linguistics| who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement, in particular: In descending order of number of speakers, widely-spoken Afroasiatic languages include:  In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Kuraish of Tiaret in |Algeria| was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic.
Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in Western Asia, |North Africa|, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel.
 Andorra Andorra (, ; ), officially the Principality of Andorra (), is a Sovereignty landlocked microstate on the |Iberian Peninsula|, in the eastern |Pyrenees|, bordered by |France| to the north and |Spain| to the south.

Proof of this event was Ràdio Andorra, number one transmitter musical radio station in Europe in this period, with guests and speakers of great importance promoting musical hits of chanson française, Swing (dance), rhythm &amp; blues, |jazz|, |rock and roll| or Country music.

The current AFC champions are the |Kansas City Chiefs|, who defeated the |Buffalo Bills| in the 2020 AFC Championship Game for their second consecutive conference championship.
The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the |Miami Dolphins| in 1966 and the |Cincinnati Bengals| in 1968) before the merger.
In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFLs launch (the |Cleveland Browns|, |Pittsburgh Steelers|, and the then-Baltimore Colts) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC.
When the |Seattle Seahawks| and the |Tampa Bay Buccaneers| joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively.
The expansion |Jacksonville Jaguars| joined the AFC in 1995.
In 1995, the |Cleveland Browns| had attempted to move to Baltimore; the resulting Cleveland Browns relocation controversy between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the |Baltimore Ravens| with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL.

 Animal Farm Animal Farm is an allegory |novella| by |George Orwell|, first published in England on 17 August 1945.
According to Orwell, the fable reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the History of the Soviet Union (1927–53) of the |Soviet Union|.
Orwell, a democratic socialism, was a critic of |Joseph Stalin| and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the |Spanish Civil War|.
In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described "Animal Farm" as a |satire| tale against Stalin (""""), and in his essay "Why I Write" (1946), wrote that "Animal Farm" was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".
Orwell suggested the title  for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the |Latin| word for "bear", a Russian bear.
Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its Allies of World War II with the Soviet Union against |Nazi Germany|, and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.
It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the |Cold War|.
"Time" magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005); it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels, and number 46 on the |BBC|s The Big Read poll.
The poorly-run Manor Farm near Willingdon and Jevington, |England|, is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer, <a href="Jones%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Mr.
George Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944 after his experiences during the |Spanish Civil War|, which he described in "Homage to Catalonia" (1938).
Immediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the |BBC|.
During the |World War II|, it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch – including his regular publisher Victor Gollancz Ltd.
Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle." The publisher Jonathan Cape, who had initially accepted "Animal Farm", subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off – although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a |Soviet Union| spy.
The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying: Frederic Warburg also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic |Red Army|, which had World War II casualties of the Soviet Union in defeating |Adolf Hitler|.
The authors stated "It was—and remains—as easy to buy "1984" and "Animal Farm" in Shenzhen or |Shanghai| as it is in London or Los Angeles." An enhanced version of the book, launched in India in 2017, was widely praised for capturing the authors intent, by republishing the proposed preface of the First Edition and the preface he wrote for the Ukrainian edition.
The "Battle of the Cowshed" has been said to represent the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War of Russian SFSR in 1918, and the defeat of the White movement in the |Russian Civil War|.
Peter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Davison (professor) contend that the "Battle of the Windmill," specifically referencing "the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Moscow," represents |World War II|.
The disagreement between the allies and the start of the |Cold War| is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, "played an ace of spades simultaneously".
In 2012, an HFR-3D version of "Animal Farm", potentially directed by |Andy Serkis|, was announced.
Tamsin Greig narrated, and the cast included Nicky Henson as Napoleon, |Toby Jones| as the propagandist Squealer, and Ralph Ineson as Boxer.
|Alan Menken| and Glenn Slater will write songs for the musical, with the book written by James Graham (playwright).
The two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb, |University of California, Berkeley| and the classification by Herpetology Darrel Frost and the American Museum of Natural History, available as the online reference database "Amphibian Species of the World".
Eventually, their bony fins would |evolution| into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
