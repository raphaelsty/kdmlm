At the entrance to the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in |Moscow|, there is a monument that includes statues of Tarkovsky, Gennady Shpalikov and Vasily Shukshin.
Tarkovsky considered |Thomas Mann| and E.
Hoffmann, and also thought about |Henrik Ibsen|s "Peer Gynt".
The list includes: "Diary of a Country Priest" and "Mouchette" by Robert Bresson; "Winter Light", "Wild Strawberries (film)", and "Persona (1966 film)" by |Ingmar Bergman|; "Nazarín" by Luis Buñuel; "City Lights" by |Charlie Chaplin|; "Ugetsu" by Kenji Mizoguchi; "Seven Samurai" by |Akira Kurosawa|, and "Woman in the Dunes" by Hiroshi Teshigahara.
Among his favorite directors were Buñuel, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, |Michelangelo Antonioni|, Jean Vigo, and Carl Theodor Dreyer.
However, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film "|The Terminator|", saying that its "vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art".
In a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky argued: "All art, of course, is intellectual, but for me, all the arts, and cinema even more so, must above all be emotional and act upon the heart." His films are characterized by |metaphysics| themes, extremely long takes, and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty.
After "Mirror", he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the Classical unities proposed by |Aristotle|: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.
|Ingmar Bergman|, a renowned director, commented on Tarkovsky: Contrarily, however, Bergman conceded the truth in the claim made by a critic who wrote that "with "Autumn Sonata" Bergman does Bergman", adding: "Tarkovsky began to make Tarkovsky films, and that |Federico Fellini| began to make Fellini films [...] Luis Buñuel nearly always made Buñuel films." This pastiche of ones own work has been derogatorily termed as "self-karaoke".
In his last film, "The Sacrifice (1986 film)", Tarkovsky worked with cinematographer |Sven Nykvist|, who had worked on many films with director |Ingmar Bergman|.
Furthermore, he directed the play "|Hamlet|" for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera "Boris Godunov (opera)" in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story "Turnabout" by |William Faulkner|.
Ambiguity is a powerful tool of |political science|.
|Martin Heidegger| argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.[3] In Heideggers phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification.
In calling his work Being and Nothingness an "essay in phenomenological ontology" |Jean-Paul Sartre| follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity.
Mathematical notation, widely used in |physics| and other |science|s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language.
Just like |Ludwig Wittgenstein| states in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: "...
|Christianity| and |Judaism| employ the concept of paradox synonymously with ambiguity.
(The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox.) In |music|, pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some polytonality, polymeter, other ambiguous metre or rhythms, and ambiguous phrase (music), or (Stein 2005, p. 79) any aspect of music.
In |computer science|, the SI prefixes kilo-, mega- and giga- were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 (1024, 1024 and 1024) contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion.
He is the younger brother of Cain, and the younger son of Adam and |Eve|, the first couple within the Biblical tale.
In |Christianity|, comparisons are sometimes made between the death of Abel and that of Jesus, the former thus seen as being the first martyr.
According to |Shia Islam| belief, Abel (""Habeel"") is buried in the Nabi Habeel Mosque, located on the west mountains of |Damascus|, near the Zabadani Valley, overlooking the villages of the Barada river (Wadi Barada), in |Syria|.
The mosque was built by |Ottoman Empire| Wali Ahmad Pasha in 1599.

 Aardvark The aardvark ( ; "Orycteropus afer") is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to |Africa|.
The name "aardvark" is |Afrikaans| (), comes from earlier Afrikaans (erdvark) and means "earth pig" or "ground pig" ("aarde": earth/ground, "vark": pig), because of its burrowing habits.
The aardvark is not closely related to the |South America|n anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance.
Based on fossils, Bryan Patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in |Africa| around the end of the Paleocene.
The first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably "Myorycteropus africanus" from |Kenya|n Miocene deposits.
The earliest example from the genus "Orycteropus" was "Orycteropus mauritanicus", found in |Algeria| in deposits from the middle Miocene, with an equally old version found in Kenya.
Fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years, and have been located throughout |Europe| and the Near East.
The mysterious Pleistocene "Plesiorycteropus" from |Madagascar| was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the Eocene.
These exceptions include the coastal areas of |Namibia|, |Ivory Coast|, and |Ghana|.
The first zoo to have one was London Zoo in 1869, which had an animal from |South Africa|.
Its name means "earth-wolf" in |Afrikaans| and Dutch language.
Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large |animal|s.
The specific name, "cristatus", comes from |Latin| and means "provided with a comb", relating to their mane.
Frankfurt Zoo in |Germany| was home to the oldest recorded aardwolf in captivity at 18 years and 11 months.
Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common throughout the world (Middle East, Western Asia, North Africa, West Africa, South America, southwestern North America, Spain, and Eastern Europe.) Adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the Americas in the Southwestern United States, Mesoamerica, and the |Andes| for several thousand years.
In more modern English usage, the term "adobe" has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of North America, especially in |New Mexico|, regardless of the construction method.

Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as Marco Polos journal "The Travels of Marco Polo" or |Mark Twain|s "Roughing It".
There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as "The Right Stuff (book)" by |Tom Wolfe|, or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as "Conquistadors of the Useless" by Lionel Terray.

Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern world on the |Eurasia|n continent.
