It is part of the field of biomechatronics, the science of using Mechanical system devices with human muscle, |skeleton|, and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by Trauma (medicine), disease, or Congenital disorder.
The use of the word "abacus" dates from before 1387 AD, when a Middle English work borrowed the word from |Latin| to describe a sandboard abacus.
Under the Parthian Empire, Sassanian and |Iran|ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – |India|, China, and the |Roman Empire|, when it is thought to have been exported to other countries.
The similarity of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the |Roman Empire| and China.
The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the Tang dynasty (618–907) when travel in the |Indian Ocean| and the |Middle East| would have provided direct contact with |India|, allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from Indian merchants and mathematicians.
The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese primary schools as part of |mathematics|, primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation.
The Chinese abacus migrated from China to |Korea| around 1400 AD.
Even the 1874 invention of mechanical calculator, Odhner Arithmometer, had not replaced them in |Russia|; according to Yakov Perelman, even in his times, some businessmen attempting to import such devices into the Russian Empire were known to give up and leave in despair after being shown the work of a skilled abacus operator.
Likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the |Soviet Union|.
The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet, who served in |Napoleon|s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.
The Turkic peoples and the |Armenians| people also used abacuses similar to the Russian schoty.

In |American English|, "asphalt" is equivalent to the British "bitumen".
In |Canadian English|, the word "bitumen" is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil, while "asphalt" is used for the oil refinery product.
Natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago and Lake Bermudez in |Venezuela|.
Bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as "oil sands" in |Alberta|, Canada, and the similar "tar sands" in |Utah|, US.
The Canadian province of |Alberta| has most of the worlds reserves, in three huge deposits covering , an area larger than |England| or New York state.
An example of this is within the Uinta Basin of |Utah|, in the US, where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed Gilsonite.
Due to pressure from the rising of the |Rocky Mountains| in southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming the oil sands.
Statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in |Japan|, and probably also in China.
In |North America|, archaeological recovery has indicated that bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to wooden shafts.
In 1553, Pierre Belon described in his work "Observations (Pierre Belon)" that "pissasphalto", a mixture of Pitch (resin) and bitumen, was used in the Republic of Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, |Croatia|) for tarring of ships.
Its rise in Europe was "a sudden phenomenon", after natural deposits were found "in France at Osbann (|Bas-Rhin|), the Parc (Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (Puy-de-Dôme)", although it could also be made artificially.
Extracts from bitumen were used to treat catarrh and some forms of |asthma| and as a remedy against worms, especially the tapeworm.
Advocacy for pavement increased in the early 20th century with the rise of the |automobile|.
Charles Avenue</a> in |New Orleans| was paved its whole length with asphalt by 1889.

Karl Clark</a> of the |University of Alberta| during the 1920s.
Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as |selenium|, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have a higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions.

The Apollo project was enabled by NASAs adoption of new advances in |semiconductor| electronic technology, including metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) and silicon integrated circuit (IC) chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC).
The initial crew assignment of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) |Buzz Aldrin| on the backup crew for Apollo9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967.
He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually |Apollo 13|).
Later, Lovells crew was forced to switch places with Alan Shepards tentative |Apollo 13| crew to give Shepard more training time.
At Scheers suggestion, the CM was named "Command module Columbia" after "Columbiad#In fiction", the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in |Jules Verne|s 1865 novel "|From the Earth to the Moon|".
In Collins 1976 book, he said "Columbia" was in reference to |Christopher Columbus|.

 Apollo 8 Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit, and also the first human spaceflight to reach another astronomical object, namely the |Moon|, which the crew orbited without landing, and then departed safely back to |Earth|.
These three |astronaut|s — Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders — were the first humans to witness and photograph an Earthrise.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the |Cold War|, a geopolitical rivalry with the |Soviet Union|.
The backup crew assignment of Neil Armstrong as Commander, Lovell as CMP, and |Buzz Aldrin| as LMP for the third crewed Apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew.
Haise served on the backup crew of Apollo11 as LMP and flew on |Apollo 13| as LMP.
The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell, who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of a Northrop T-38 Talon flight from |California| to |Houston| shortly after learning of Apollo8s re-designation as a lunar-orbital mission.
The crew would have likely chosen "Columbiad", the name of the giant cannon that launches a space vehicle in |Jules Verne|s 1865 novel "|From the Earth to the Moon|".
Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the |Soviet Union|s Zond 5 mission, which flew some living creatures, including Russian tortoises, in a cislunar loop around the Moon and returned them to Earth on September 21.

"Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality or allegiance, however astronauts fielded by |Russia| or the |Soviet Union| are typically known instead as cosmonauts (from the Russian language "kosmos" (космос), meaning "universe", also borrowed from Greek) in order to distinguish them from United States or otherwise NATO-oriented space travallers, particularly in the context of the Space Race.
Comparatively recent developments in manned spaceflight made by the China and other East Asian nations have also lead to the rise of the term taikonaut (from the |Standard Chinese| "tàikōng" (太空), meaning "space") although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear.
Of these, List of Apollo astronauts have traveled beyond low Earth orbit, either to lunar orbit, the lunar surface, or, in one case, a loop around the |Moon|.
In 1959, when both the United States and |Soviet Union| were planning, but had yet to launch humans into space, NASA Administrator <a href="T.%20Keith%20Glennan">T.
Dryden preferred "cosmonaut", on the grounds that flights would occur in and to the broader "cosmos", while the "astro" prefix suggested flight specifically to the |star|s.
The phrase (, "spaceman") is often used in |Hong Kong| and |Taiwan|.
The origin of the term is unclear; as early as May 1998, Chiew Lee Yih () from |Malaysia|, used it in newsgroups.
For example, the term "spationaut" () is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the |Latin| word for "space"; the Malay language term (deriving from "Akasha" meaning space) was used to describe participants in the Angkasawan program (note its similarity with the Indonesian language term "antariksawan"); and, the Indian Space Research Organisation hope to launch a Gaganyaan in 2022 that would carry "vyomanauts", coined from the Sanskrit word ( meaning sky or space).
