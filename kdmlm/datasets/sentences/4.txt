The abstract noun "wikt:anthropology" is first attested in reference to |history|.
Its present use first appeared in German Renaissance |Holy Roman Empire| in the works of Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann.
Their New Latin  derived from the combining forms of the Ancient Greek words "ánthrōpos" (, "human") and "lógos" (, "|science|").
(Its adjectival form appeared in the works of |Aristotle|.) It began to be used in English, possibly via French language , by the early 18th century.
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the |University of Copenhagen|, defined "" as follows: Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the National Museum of Natural History, France by Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau.
For them, the publication of |Charles Darwin|s "On the Origin of Species" was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect.
Anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of "Human", human physical traits, human behavior, the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of "Homo sapiens" has influenced its social organization and culture, and from |social science|s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.
Cultural anthropology is more related to |philosophy|, literature and the arts (how ones culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the peoples knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to |sociology| and history.
This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, |newspaper|, new media, and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.

 Alchemy Alchemy (from |Arabic|: "al-kīmiyā") is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, a philosophical and protoscience tradition practiced throughout Europe, Africa, China and throughout Asia, observable in Chinese alchemy text from around 73–49 BCE and Egypt (Roman province) in the first few centuries CE.
Common aims were chrysopoeia, the Transmutation of elements of "base metals" (e.g., lead) into "noble metals" (particularly |gold|); the creation of an Elixir of life; the creation of Panacea (medicine) able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent.
Their work was guided by Hermeticism related to Magic (paranormal), |mythology|, and |religion|.
This name was itself brought from the |Arabic| word "al-kīmiyā" ( or ) composed of two parts: the Late Greek term "khēmeía" (χημεία), also spelled "khumeia" (χυμεία) and "khēmía" (χημία), and the Arabic definite article "al-" (), meaning The.
Chinese alchemy was closely connected to |Taoism| and Indian alchemy with the Indian religions.
The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and Hellenistic Egypt, where the city of |Alexandria| was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.
Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging |Christianity|.
|Augustine of Hippo| later affirmed this in the 4th & 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.
|Buddhism| texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold.
Much more is known about |Islam|ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.
|Plato|nic and |Aristotle| thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through Syriac language translations and scholarship.
