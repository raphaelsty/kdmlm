In |Finland|, the NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra, a Finnish Americans, has sometimes been referred to as , from the Finnish language word .
The Soviet Union, through its Intercosmos program, allowed people from other "|socialism|" (i.e.
Warsaw Pact and other Soviet-allied) countries to fly on its missions, with the notable exceptions of |France| and |Austria| participating in Soyuz TM-7 and Soyuz TM-13, respectively.
On July 23, 1980, Pham Tuan of |Vietnam| became the first |Asian people| in space when he flew aboard Soyuz 37.
Also in 1980, Cubans Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez became the first person of |Hispanic| and black African descent to fly in space, and in 1983, Guion Bluford became the first African American to fly into space.
In 1985, |Saudi Arabia|n Sultan Salman al-Saud became the first Arab Muslim astronaut in space.
In 1988, Abdul Ahad Mohmand became the first |Afghanistan| to reach space, spending nine days aboard the "Mir" space station.
The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was , when Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise went around the Moon during the |Apollo 13| emergency.
Lichtenberg</a>, a researcher from the |Massachusetts Institute of Technology| who flew on STS-9 in 1983.
More recently, in 2017, bacteria were found to be more resistant to |antibiotic|s and to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space.
On December 31, 2012, a NASA-supported study reported that human spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of |Alzheimer's disease|.
In October 2018, NASA-funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space, including travel to the |Mars|, may substantially damage the Gastrointestinal tract of astronauts.
By nationality, thirteen were American (including one born in India), four were Russian (|Soviet Union|), and one was Israeli.
 A Modest Proposal A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick, commonly referred to as A Modest Proposal, is a Juvenalian satire essay written and published anonymously by |Jonathan Swift| in 1729.
This satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as |Kingdom of Great Britain| policy toward the Irish in general.
He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which Parody the then-influential William Petty and the Social engineering (political science) popular among followers of |Francis Bacon|.
These lampoons include appeal to authority of "a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London" and "the famous George Psalmanazar, a native of the island |Taiwan|" (who had already confessed to "not" being from Formosa in 1706).
Edmund Wilson argues that statistically "the logic of the Modest proposal can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated to |Karl Marx|) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population".
|John Locke| commented: "Be it then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, it was usual for Men to sell and Castrate their Children.
In his book "A Modest Proposal" (1984), the evangelical author Francis Schaeffer emulated Swifts work in a social conservative polemic against abortion and euthanasia, imagining a future |dystopia| that advocates recycling of aborted embryos, fetuses, and some disabled infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties.
In the 1998 edition of "The Handmaid's Tale" by |Margaret Atwood| there is a quote from "A Modest Proposal" before the introduction.
Thompson</a>s "Fear and Loathing in America" includes a letter in which he uses Swifts approach in connection with the |Vietnam War|.
Alkali metal The alkali metals consist of the chemical elements lithium (Li), |sodium| (Na), |potassium| (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr).
|Salt|, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity.
Petalite (Lithium Aluminium SiliconOxygen) was discovered in 1800 by the |Brazil|ian chemist José Bonifácio de Andrada in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden.
Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in |Heidelberg|, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite.
The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectrum: a bright red line for rubidium (from the |Latin| word "rubidus", meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word "caesius", meaning sky-blue).
His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as |copper|, |silver|, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group.
In this 1871 version, copper, silver, and |gold| were placed twice, once as part of group 11 element, and once as part of a "group VIII" encompassing todays groups group 8 element to 11.
The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with |calcium|-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California.
The |Earth| formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system.
It is composed mostly of |iron| (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), |magnesium| (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), |calcium| (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.
Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth, both being among the ten abundance of elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the |Earth|s crust measured by weight, making it the Abundance of the chemical elements overall and the most abundant alkali metal.
Many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as |Utah|s Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea.
Rubidium is approximately as abundant as |zinc| and more abundant than copper.
Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals |calcium|, strontium, and barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium.
Lithium and |magnesium| have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii, so that they show some similarities.
If the bond between |sodium| and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent bond, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium.
They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, |zinc|, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates.
Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with |gold|, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and caesium auride are semiconductors.
The intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor Electrical conductor or |semiconductor|s, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl phase involved.
All the alkali metals react readily with |phosphorus| and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula MPn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth).
The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens (sulfur, |selenium|, tellurium, and polonium), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of franciums).
Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals |calcium|, strontium, barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium.
It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or |silver| compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl (164 picometer), K (152 pm) and Ag (129 pm) ions.
The group 11 element (or coinage metals), |copper|, |silver|, and |gold|, are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells.
The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and |magnesium| or |calcium| for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride.
Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization (chemistry) of a rubidium and caesium alum (Caesium, Rubidium)Aluminium(Sulfate)·12|Water|, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations.
Pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with |calcium| metal at 750 °C and low pressure.
Lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in |psychiatry| to treat |bipolar disorder| (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2 grams, although there are side-effects.
Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute |cardiac arrest|, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources.
Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of Goiânia, |Brazil|, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium chloride sold to curious, uneducated buyers.
Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former |Soviet Union|.
In |Korea|, the Hangul alphabet was created by Sejong the Great.
Zhuyin (sometimes called "Bopomofo") is a semi-syllabary used to phonetically transcribe |Standard Chinese| in the |Taiwan|.
After the later establishment of the China and its adoption of Pinyin, the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it is still widely used in |Taiwan| where the Republic of China still governs.
Examples of present-day abjads are the Arabic script and Hebrew scripts; true alphabets include Latin script, Cyrillic, and Korean hangul; and abugidas are used to write tigrinya language, Amharic language, |Hindi|, and Thai language.
On the other hand, the Phagspa script of the |Mongol Empire| was based closely on the Tibetan script, but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks.
The basic ordering of the Latin alphabet (A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y |Z|), which is derived from the Northwest Semitic "Abgad" order, is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the French language "é", "à", and "ô") and of certain combinations of letters (Multigraph (orthography)).
The names were abandoned in Latin alphabet, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were Y and |Z|, which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as "Y Graeca" "Greek Y" (pronounced "I Graeca" "Greek I") and "zeta" (from Greek)—this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term "zed" for Z in all forms of English other than American English.
These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when |Turkey| switched from the Arabic alphabet to a Latin-based Turkish alphabet.
In 1911, |Ernest Rutherford| gave a Rutherford model of the atom in which a central nucleus held most of the atoms mass and a positive charge which, in units of the electrons charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atoms atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms.
 Anatomy Anatomy (Greek "anatomē", dissection) is the branch of |biology| concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.
Human body is one of the essential basic sciences that are Applied science in |medicine|.
Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and |biochemistry|, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved.
The extracellular matrix contains |protein|s, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen.
The matrix can be modified to form a |skeleton| to support or protect the body.
This is one of the arguments put forward by |Charles Darwin| to support his theory of |evolution|.
Generally, students of certain |biology|, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physical therapy, occupational therapy, |nursing|, podiatry, and medical school learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers.
A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially |surgery| and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.
The Hellenistic Egyptian city of |Alexandria| was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology.
|Aristotle| described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection.
Also in the 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in |Alexandria| during the Ptolemaic Kingdom.
Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists Mondino de Luzzi, Alessandro Achillini and Antonio Benivieni at |Bologna| carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times.
|Leonardo da Vinci| (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by Andrea del Verrocchio.
Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), professor of anatomy at the |University of Padua|, is considered the founder of modern human anatomy.
The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir John Struthers (anatomist), Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen) at the |University of Aberdeen| from 1863 to 1889.
Example 4 In "|Catch-22|", the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being "Washington Irving"/"Irving Washington", who has been blocking out large portions of soldiers letters home.
Tarkovsky studied film at Moscows Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently directed his first five feature films in the |Soviet Union|: "Ivan's Childhood" (1962), "Andrei Rublev (film)" (1966), "Solaris (1972 film)" (1972), "Mirror (1975 film)" (1975), and "Stalker (1979 film)" (1979).
Tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the |Cannes Film Festival| throughout his career (including the International Federation of Film Critics, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, and the Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)) and winner of the |Golden Lion| award at the |Venice Film Festival| for his debut film "Ivans Childhood".
 Andreis paternal grandfather Aleksandr Karlovich Tarkovsky (in ) was a |Poles| nobleman who worked as a bank clerk.
She was married to Ivan Ivanovich Vishnyakov, a native of the Kaluga Governorate who studied law at the |Moscow State University| and served as a judge in Kozelsk.
From November 1947 to spring 1948 he was in the hospital with |tuberculosis|.
He still managed to graduate, and from 1951 to 1952 studied |Arabic| at the Oriental Institute in Moscow, a branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.
This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the Italian neorealism, French New Wave, and of directors such as |Akira Kurosawa|, Luis Buñuel, |Ingmar Bergman|, Robert Bresson, |Andrzej Wajda| (whose film "Ashes and Diamonds (film)" influenced Tarkovsky) and Kenji Mizoguchi.
In 1956 Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, "The Killers (1956 film)", from a short story of |Ernest Hemingway|.
The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the |Golden Lion| award at the |Venice Film Festival| in the year 1962.
A version of the film was presented at the |Cannes Film Festival| in 1969 and won the International Federation of Film Critics.
The film was presented at the |Cannes Film Festival|, won the Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival) and the International Federation of Film Critics, and was nominated for the |Palme d'Or|.
In December 1976, he directed "|Hamlet|", his only stage play, at the Lenkom Theatre in Moscow.
The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the |Cannes Film Festival|.
During the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary "Voyage in Time" together with his long-time friend |Tonino Guerra|.
"Nostalghia" was presented at the |Cannes Film Festival| and won the International Federation of Film Critics and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.
Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the |Palme d'Or|, a fact that hardened Tarkovskys resolve to never work in the Soviet Union again.
At a press conference in |Milan| on 10 July 1984, he announced that he would never return to the Soviet Union and would remain in Europe.
"The Sacrifice" was presented at the |Cannes Film Festival| and received the Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival), the International Federation of Film Critics and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.
At the |Venice Film Festival| he was awarded the |Golden Lion| for "Ivan's Childhood".
At the |Cannes Film Festival|, he won the International Federation of Film Critics four times, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury three times (more than any other director), and the Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival) twice.
He was also nominated for the |Palme d'Or| two times.
|Ingmar Bergman| was quoted as saying: "Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [of us all], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream".
