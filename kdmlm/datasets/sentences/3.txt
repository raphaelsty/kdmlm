|Buddhism|, |Christianity|, |Hinduism|, |Islam|, Jainism, |Judaism|, and |Sikhism|, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse." In |Islam|, the concept ""īthār"" (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of "preferring others to oneself".
The importance of "īthār" lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; |Islam| considers those practicing "īthār" as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.

Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum () on February 2, 1905, to a Russian-Jewish bourgeois family living in |Saint Petersburg|.
At the prestigious , her closest friend was |Vladimir Nabokov|s younger sister, Olga.
The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the Nabokov House: while Olga defended |constitutional monarchy|, Alisa supported republicanism.
The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under |Vladimir Lenin| disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed.
Her fathers business was confiscated, and the family fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under control of the White Army during the |Russian Civil War|.
At the university she was introduced to the writings of |Aristotle| and |Plato|, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.
She also studied the philosophical works of |Friedrich Nietzsche|.
Able to read French, German and Russian, she also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, |Victor Hugo|, Edmond Rostand, and |Friedrich Schiller|, who became her perennial favorites.
By this time, she had decided her professional surname for writing would be "Rand", possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt of her birth surname in Cyrillic handwriting, and she adopted the first name "Ayn", either from a Finnic languages name "Aino (given name)" or from the |Hebrew| word ("ayin", meaning "eye").
When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of |Manhattan| that she cried what she later called "tears of splendor".
Rands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay "Red Pawn" to |Universal Studios| in 1932, although it was never produced.
In 1941, |Paramount Pictures| produced a The Night of January 16th (film).
She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist |Ludwig von Mises|.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, |Princeton University|, |Columbia University|, Harvard, and the |Massachusetts Institute of Technology|.
These included supporting abortion rights, opposing the |Vietnam War| and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as "bums"), supporting Israel in the |Yom Kippur War| of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as "civilized men fighting savages", saying European colonization of the Americas had the right to develop land taken from Indigenous peoples of the Americas, and calling homosexuality "immoral" and "disgusting", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.
She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on |metaphysics|, |epistemology|, ethics, |political philosophy|, and |aesthetics|.
In |epistemology|, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic, and reason, which she described as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses".
She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, |Nazism|, fascism, |communism|, democratic socialism, and dictatorship.
She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with |anarchism|.
Rand acknowledged |Aristotle| as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend "three As"—Aristotle, |Thomas Aquinas|, and Ayn Rand.
I devised the rest of my philosophy myself." However, she also found early inspiration in |Friedrich Nietzsche|, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rands journals, in passages from the first edition of "We the Living" (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style.
Rand considered her philosophical opposite to be |Immanuel Kant|, whom she referred to as "the most evil man in mankinds history", primarily for his philosophy regarding the limitations of reason.
She believed |epistemology| was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating: "I am not "primarily" an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not "primarily" an advocate of egoism, but of reason.
Mencken</a>, her Broadway play "Night of January 16th" was both a critical and popular success, and "The Fountainhead" was hailed by "|The New York Times|" reviewer Lorine Pruette as "masterful".
The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, "For the New Intellectual", was similar to that for "Atlas Shrugged", with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to "the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union", and author |Gore Vidal| calling her viewpoint "nearly perfect in its immorality".
In 2005, on the 100th anniversary of Rands birth, Edward Rothstein, writing for "|The New York Times|", referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian "retro fantasy" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters "isolated rejection of democratic society".
Reviewing the posthumously published novel Ideal (novel), "|The New York Times|" chief book critic Michiko Kakutani assessed Rands "didactic, ideological work" as stylistically having a great deal "in common with the message-minded socialist realism produced in the Soviet Union, which she left in the mid-1920s and vociferously denounced".
Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist |Steve Ditko| and musician Neil Peart of Rush (band), although he later distanced himself.
John A. Allison IV of BB&amp;T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rands ideas, while |Mark Cuban| (owner of the |Dallas Mavericks|) as well as <a href="John%20P.%20Mackey">John P.
A 1997 documentary film, "", was nominated for the |Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|.
A 1987 article in "|The New York Times|" referred to her as the Presidency of Ronald Reagans "novelist laureate".
Republican |United States Congress| and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels.
One of these was "On the Randian Argument" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is–ought problem posed by |David Hume|.
He attributes the attention she receives to her being a "compelling writer", especially as a novelist, noting that "Atlas Shrugged" outsells Rands non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as |Ludwig von Mises|, |Friedrich Hayek|, or Frederic Bastiat.
One acts in the way that one finds most pleasant." Regarding Rands particular disdain for the philosophy of |Immanuel Kant|, philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.
