Anarchism Anarchism is a |political philosophy| and Political movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy.
It is usually described alongside libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement and as having a historical association with anti-capitalism and |socialism|.
Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the |Spanish Civil War|, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism.
Various factions within the |French Revolution| labelled their opponents as "anarchists", although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists.
Since the 1890s and beginning in France, "|libertarianism|" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.
Additionally, some anarchists use "libertarian socialist" to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with |socialism|.
Adams and Carl Levy (political scientist) write that "anarchism" is used to "describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement." |Noam Chomsky| describes anarchism, alongside libertarian Marxism, as "the libertarian wing of socialism." Daniel Guérin wrote: <blockquote>[A]narchism is really a synonym for socialism.
In |Basra|, religious sects preached against the state.
During the |French Revolution|, partisan groups such as the Enragés and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.
This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the |Spanish Civil War| and is considered the golden age of anarchism.
The International became a significant political force, with |Karl Marx| being a leading figure and a member of its General Council.
Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting |Russian Civil War|, many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.
The |Soviet Union| provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as |Joseph Stalin| tried to seize control of the Republican faction (Spanish Civil War).
At the end of |World War II|, the anarchist movement was severely weakened.
However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of Marxism–Leninism and tensions built by the |Cold War|.
Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the |World Trade Organization| (WTO), the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum.
During the protests, "ad hoc" leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with the |police|.
Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since |ethics| have a central role in anarchist philosophy.
Anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a Horizontalidad network of voluntary associations, workers' councils and worker cooperatives, with production and consumption based on the guiding principle "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need." Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the |French Revolution|, but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International.
Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William Godwin, Max Stirner and |Henry David Thoreau|.
However, its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as |anthropology| and |history| to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory.
Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed |terrorism| as propaganda of the deed.
As anarchism is a |philosophy| that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, schools of thought, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common.
Phenomena such as civilisation, |technology| (e.g.
Christian anarchist |Leo Tolstoy|, who published the essay "Education and Culture", also established a similar school with its founding principle being that "for education to be effective it had to be free." In a similar token, A.
Anarchists such as |Leo Tolstoy| and Herbert Read argued that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.
Philosopher |Bertrand Russell| supported this critique, stating that "[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government." Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing.
Noted autistic |Temple Grandin| described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with typical neural development, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".
Environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, |infectious disease|s, solvents, Polychlorinated biphenyl, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, Ethanol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines, and prenatal stress.
Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of |psychiatry|, |psychology|, neurology and |pediatrics|.
The preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein-free diets, as a consequence of the low intake of |calcium| and vitamin D; however, suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disease.
Albedo is an important concept in climatology, |astronomy|, and environmental management (e.g., as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings).
The average albedo of |Earth| is about 0.3.
The albedos of |planet|s, Natural satellite and minor planets such as |asteroid|s can be used to infer much about their properties.
For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer |Solar System| objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in |asteroid|s.
The overall albedo of the |Moon| is measured to be around 0.14, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian reflectance, displaying also a strong opposition effect.
Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the |Earth|.
Over |Antarctica| snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8.
Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for |global warming|.
When the |Ancient Greece| adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician language and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha.
The Romans later adopted the Old Italic script to write the |Latin|, and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin script that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.
At the end of the |Roman Empire| (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe.
Among these were the semicursive minuscule of |Italy|, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular script or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain.
In |geometry|, capital A, B, C etc.
A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a |triangle|, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.

 Achilles In |Greek mythology|, Achilles ( ) or Achilleus (, ) was a hero of the Trojan War, the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of Homers "Iliad".
Achilles most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of |Troy|.
Later legends (beginning with Statius unfinished epic "Achilleid", written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel, because when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river |Styx| as an infant, she held him by one of his heels.
The whole expression would be comparable to the |Latin| "acupedius" "swift of foot".
Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for Thetiss hand in marriage until |Prometheus|, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by Themis, goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father.
According to the "Achilleid", written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to Lost works, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river |Styx|; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel (see Achilles' heel, Achilles' tendon).
According to the "Cypria" (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles wrath), when the Achaeans (Homer) desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighbouring cities (like Pedasus and Lyrnessus, where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis) and killed Tenes, a son of Apollo, as well as Priams son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios; however, the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucers "Troilus and Criseyde" and in |William Shakespeare|s "Troilus and Cressida" is a medieval invention.
During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to Hesperus, the evening/western star (|Venus|), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus (morning star), the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).
He was represented in the "Aethiopis" as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river |Danube|.
