The city was visited in 333 BCE by |Alexander the Great|, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the "Iliad" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of Pausanias (geographer) in the 2nd century CE.
The tomb of Achilles, extant throughout antiquity in Troad, was venerated by Thessalians, but also by Persians expeditionary forces, as well as by |Alexander the Great| and the Roman emperor Caracalla.
on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades, in |Sparta| which had a sanctuary, in Elis and in Achilles homeland Thessaly, as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Taranto, Locri and Crotone, accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero.
An archaic cult is attested for the Miletus colony of Olbia (archaeological site) as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with Snake Island (Black Sea) (Ukrainian language Зміїний, "Zmiinyi", near Kiliya, |Ukraine|).
43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named "Achillea", situated between the Borysthenes and the |Danube|, adding to the geographical confusion.
|Alexander the Great|, son of the Epirote princess Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor.
The |tragedy| Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title "Achilleis" by modern scholars.
In "Hippias Minor", a dialogue attributed to |Plato|, an arrogant man named Hippias argues with Socrates.
Lincoln led the nation through the |American Civil War|, the countrys greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the American frontier primarily in |Indiana|.
He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party (United States) leader, |Illinois| state Illinois House of Representatives, and U.S.
To secure its independence, the new |Confederate States of America| Battle of Fort Sumter, a U.S.
His Gettysburg Address became a historic clarion call for |nationalism|, republicanism, Civil and political rights, liberty, and |democracy|.
The family then migrated west, passing through |New Jersey|, |Pennsylvania|, and |Virginia|.
Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and |Tennessee| before the family settled in Hardin County, Kentucky in the early 1800s.
In 1816, the family moved to |Indiana| where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.
At seventeen, Abraham left the family home for a while to work on a ferry across the Anderson River (Indiana) near its junction with the |Ohio River|.
In April 1828, he signed a contract with James Gentry, a neighboring settler, under which he was to bring a boat of agricultural products to |New Orleans|.
The journey lasted three months, during which he traveled with one of Gentrys sons to |Ohio| and then to |Mississippi|, where they had to face strong currents and an attack on their cargo.
Back in |Indiana|, Abraham gave his father the $25 this contract earned him.
In March 1830, when Abraham was 21, Thomas Lincoln decided to move to the fertile lands of |Illinois|, on the edge of the Sangamon River.
She died on August 25, 1835, most likely of |typhoid fever|.
Lincoln suffered from "history of depression", a condition now thought to be |major depressive disorder|.
Then followed his four terms in the Illinois House of Representatives for |Sangamon County|.
In 1837 he declared, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils." He echoed Henry Clays support for the American Colonization Society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in |Liberia|.
Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General |Zachary Taylor| for the Whig nomination in the 1848 United States presidential election.
The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State |James Buchanan| and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore.
Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the |Confederate States of America|, and adopted a constitution.
|William Tecumseh Sherman| talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war.
Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the |Mississippi River|.
In the spring of 1863 Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, |Ulysses S. Grant| on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.
|Ulysses S. Grant| victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln.
He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grants political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since |George Washington|.
The prior proclamation had been during |James Madison|s presidency 50 years earlier.
|West Virginia| was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863.
|Nevada|, which became the third state in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.
Poet |Walt Whitman| composed "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.
Later in life, Lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs and might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelicalism |Protestantism|.
Lincoln is believed to have had depression (mood), |smallpox|, and |malaria|.
scholars ranking presidents</a> conducted since 1948, the top three presidents are Lincoln, Washington, and |Franklin Delano Roosevelt|, although the order varies.
Kennedy</a>, and |Ronald Reagan| have been the top-ranked presidents in eight surveys, according to Gallup.
Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, "helped lead America to the nationalism of |Theodore Roosevelt|, |Woodrow Wilson|, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt." In the New Deal era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state.
In the |Cold War| years, Lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by Communist regimes.
On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet |John Keats| and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason".
In the 21st century, President |Barack Obama| named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the Lincoln Bible for his inaugural ceremonies.
The |United States Navy| is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name.
Lincoln Memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nations capital, and is one of the top five visited |National Park Service| sites in the country.
 Aristotle Aristotle (; "Aristotélēs", ; 384–322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical Greece in |Ancient Greece|.
Taught by |Plato|, he was the founder of the Lyceum (Classical), the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelianism tradition.
His writings cover many subjects including Physics (Aristotle), |biology|, |zoology|, |metaphysics|, |logic|, |ethics|, |aesthetics|, Poetics (Aristotle), theatre, |music|, rhetoric, |psychology|, |linguistics|, |economics|, |politics|, and government.
At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined Plato's Academy in |Athens| and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (Circa 347 BC).
Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored |Alexander the Great| beginning in 343 BC.
He influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400) during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the Scholasticism tradition of the |Catholic Church|.
Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher" and among medieval Christians like |Thomas Aquinas| as simply "The Philosopher".
Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose" in Ancient Greek, was born in 384 BC in Stagira (ancient city), Chalcidice, about 55 km (34 miles) east of modern-day |Thessaloniki|.
In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son |Alexander the Great|.
|Immanuel Kant| stated in the "Critique of Pure Reason" that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.
With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? Since, according to |Plato| there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.
Aristotles immanent realism means his |epistemology| is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Theory of Forms (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.
John Philoponus (in the Middle Ages) and |Galileo Galilei| are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.
A contrary opinion is given by Carlo Rovelli, who argues that Aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the |Earth|s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air.
In |astronomy|, Aristotle refuted Democrituss claim that the Milky Way was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays," pointing out correctly that if "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then...
the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them." Aristotle was one of the first people to record any |geology| observations.
|Charles Darwin|, too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of |evolution|.
Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of |animal|s, arranging these in the "History of Animals" in a graded scale of perfection, a "scala naturae", with man at the top.
Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (mammals), and the egg-laying (|bird|s, reptiles, fish).
Aristotles |psychology|, given in his treatise "On the Soul" ("peri psychēs"), posits three kinds of soul ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul.
Aristotles practical philosophy covers areas such as |ethics|, |politics|, |economics|, and rhetoric.
Aristotle made substantial contributions to |economics|, especially to thought in the Middle Ages.
For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or |silver|.
Aristotles discussions on |retail| and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages.
Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of |zoology|, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.
Aristotles influence over |Alexander the Great| is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers.
It is not until the age of |Alexandria| under the Ptolemaic Kingdom that advances in biology can be again found.
Averroes, |Avicenna| and Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced |Thomas Aquinas| and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers.
The title "teacher" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of |Dante Alighieri|) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.
The Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in "The Divine Comedy": In the Early Modern period, scientists such as William Harvey in England and |Galileo Galilei| in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment.
The 19th-century German philosopher |Friedrich Nietzsche| has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.
It was |Martin Heidegger|, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.
The philosopher |Bertrand Russell| argued that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine".
 Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder, Justus van Gent, |Raphael|, Paolo Veronese, Jusepe de Ribera, Rembrandt, and Francesco Hayez over the centuries.
Rembrandts "Aristotle with a Bust of Homer", too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age: as the art critic Jonathan Jones (journalist) writes, "this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time."  The Aristotle Mountains in |Antarctica| are named after Aristotle.
 An American in Paris An American in Paris is a jazz-influenced orchestral piece by American composer |George Gershwin| first performed in 1928.
It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in |Paris| and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the "Années folles".
Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus |celesta|, saxophones, and automobile horns.
Ravels tour reignited Gershwins desire to return to Paris, which he and his brother |Ira Gershwin| did after meeting Ravel.
Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers, among them |Ezra Pound|, <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W.
Yeats</a>, |Ernest Hemingway|; and artist |Pablo Picasso|.
The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers |Claude Debussy| and Les Six.
Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers César Franck, |Richard Wagner|, or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere.
Gershwin responded to the critics: "An American in Paris" was originally scored for 3 |flute|s (3rd doubling on piccolo), 2 |oboe|s, English horn, 2 |clarinet|s in soprano clarinet, |bass clarinet| in B-flat, 2 |bassoon|s, contrabassoon, 4 |French horn| in F, 3 |trumpet|s in B-flat, 3 |trombone|s, |tuba|, |timpani|, |snare drum|, |bass drum|, Triangle (musical instrument), Woodblock (instrument), Ratchet (instrument), |cymbal|s, low and high Tom-tom drum, |xylophone|, |glockenspiel|, |celesta|, 4 vehicle horn labeled as A, B, C and D with circles around them, |alto saxophone|, |tenor saxophone|, |baritone saxophone|, (all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones) and String section.
The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the |University of Michigan|, were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwins true intent.
Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief |celesta| solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.
Harry James released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album "One Night Stand," recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom (Chicago) (|Columbia Records| GL 522 and CL 522).
In 1951, |Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer| released the musical film "An American in Paris (film)", featuring |Gene Kelly| and |Leslie Caron|.
Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by |Vincente Minnelli|, featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the "An American in Paris" symphonic poem (arranged for the film by |Johnny Green|), costing $500,000.
The categorys original name was Best Art Direction, but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the |85th Academy Awards|.
This change resulted from the Art Directors branch of the |Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences| (AMPAS) being renamed the Designers branch.
The films below are listed with their production year (for example, the |72nd Academy Awards| for Best Art Direction is given to a film from 1999).
Given annually by the |Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences| (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by the Academys voting membership.
